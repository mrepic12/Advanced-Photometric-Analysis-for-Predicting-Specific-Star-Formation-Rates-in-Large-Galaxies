# Advanced Photometric Analysis for Predicting Specific Star Formation Rates in Large Galaxies

Project Overview

Evaluated the effectiveness of Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs), Conditional GANs (CGANs), and Contrastive GANs (ContraGANs) for generating synthetic data to predict the B-V color index in astronomical datasets. Assessed models based on predictive accuracy, clustering quality, and statistical alignment. ContraGAN outperformed other models with the lowest MSE of 0.1294, highest R² of 0.7258, and superior clustering scores. Highlighted the benefits of contrastive learning and conditional generation for synthetic data applications in scientific and industrial fields.
